## Description

ðŸ’¡ Remember: A README file acts like a virtual storefront to a repository. A high-quality README file explains what your application does and why you used the technologies that you did. At a bare minimum, a README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how of the project. Your README might also describe some of the challenges you faced, as well as the features you plan to implement in the future.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
- What makes your project stand out?
